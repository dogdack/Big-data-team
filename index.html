  <p>"Big data" is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source.  Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] Other concepts later attributed to big data are veracity (i.e., how much noise is in the data) [4] and value.[5]
